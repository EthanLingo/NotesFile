constraint (4.2). This states that for every pure strategy j of player 1, his expected utility for playing any action $j ∈ A$ 1given player 2’s mixed strategy $s_2$ is at most $U_1^∗$. Those pure strategies for which the expected utility is exactly $U_1^∗$will be in player 1’s best response set, while those pure strategies leading to lower expected utility will not.

可以使用[[Lemke-Howson algorithm]]求解。
